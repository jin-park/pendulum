# Pendulum

Pendulum is a Swift app playground that demonstrates the wonderful world of double pendulums. You can add, customize, and watch multiple double pendulums swinging in all its dynamic glory. To try out the app, install the Swift Playgrounds app on iPad or macOS and run the project.

## Notes

The parts of the code dealing with the motion of the double pendulum was mostly based on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tc2ah-KnDXw)

This was my submission (rejected) to the WWDC23 swift student challenge.
